//Start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case,the sum is 188.->
//Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, ->
// to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.

// To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first.
//  What will your final score be if you choose that board?
